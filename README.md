# Marco Theory Project 4

## Requirements
Running this data requires the use of R Studio and Matlab. 

Make sure to have Dynare installed in Matlab in order to run code. 

The following packages need to be installed on RStudio before running the script:
 - stringr
 - dplyr
 - lubridate
 - ggplot2
 - ipumsr
 - data.table


## Part 1
### Simulating DSGE Model

For this section, you need to input the Macro Hw4 Matlab Code.txt file into Matlab in order to properly run the code. 

 1. Define your list of endegenous variables using var, your list of exogenous variables using varexo, and your list of parameters given by the report.
 2. Define your model using the Equlibium equations given.
 3. Create a steady state using the fuction steady.
 4. Define a shock category, using variable z as the shock, periods as the number of periods, and values as the value of the shock.
 5. Run the shock for a 100 periods and print output using the perfect foresight solver function
 6. Graph the data on a line plot

## Part 2
### Labor Market Flows and the COVID-19 Pandemic

#### Running Rates
